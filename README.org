The files in this repository are used for two purposes. One
(default.nix) is a package for [[https://github.com/sethnine/undock-compose][sethnine's fork]] of [[https://github.com/arifer612/undock-compose][unDOCK-compose]] and
the other (container.nix) to create a docker image for that package.

* Running on unraid
** docker run
Below will output your config files to a folder named "out" in your
current directory.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  docker run -v /boot/config/plugins/dockerMan/templates-user:/in:ro \
             -v ./out:/out:rw \
             undock
#+END_SRC

** docker compose
You will need to replace OUTPUTDIRECTORYHERE with where you want your
files to be output to. Run with ~docker compose up~.

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
  # compose.yml
  services:
    image: undock
    volumes:
      - /boot/config/plugins/dockerMan/templates-user:/in:ro
      - OUTPUTDIRECTORYHERE:/out:rw
    environment:
      UNDOCK_INPUT: /in
      UNDOCK_OUTPUT: /out
      UNDOCK_FILTER: .*xml
#+END_SRC

* Using the container
First follow the [[*Building the container][Building the container]] section then loop back around
to here.
** docker run
You will need to replace INPUTDIRECTORYHERE with where you want your
input files are stired and OUTPUTDIRECTORYHERE with your desired
output directory.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  docker run -v INPUTDIRECTORYHERE:/in:ro \
             -v OUTPUTDIRECTORYHERE:/out:rw \
             undock
#+END_SRC

** docker compose
This has the same requirements as the [[*docker run][docker run]] config, additionally
you may set a filter for the input files following [[https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html][python regex rules]].
#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
  # compose.yml
  services:
    image: undock
    volumes:
      - /boot/config/plugins/dockerMan/templates-user:/in:ro
      - ./out:/out:rw
    environment:
      UNDOCK_INPUT: /in
      UNDOCK_OUTPUT: /out
      UNDOCK_FILTER: .*xml
#+END_SRC

* Building the container
1. Get the repo ~git clone "https://github.com/sethnine/undock-nix.git"~
2. Cd to the repo ~cd undock-nix~
3. Build the container using [[https://nixos.org/download][nix]] ~nix-build container.nix~
4. Build and load the image ~./result | docker load~
5. The image is now installed and ready for use ðŸŽ‰
